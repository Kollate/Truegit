# Delete a blog

To remote your blog from Truegit, you can simply remove the `truegit.yaml` file from the root of your repository. With this option, when you choose to bring back your blog live, simpe add `truegit.yaml` file again. Alternatively, you can remote the repository from the dashboard. In this case, we never check your repository for `truegit.yaml` file again.
